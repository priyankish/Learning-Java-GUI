#Simple Animation 

The steps in a simple animation are - 

1)  Paint an object at a particular x and y coordinate
       g.fillOval(20,50,100,100);
       
2) Repaint the object at a different x and y coordinate
       g.fillOval(25,55,100,100);
       
3)Repeat the previous step with changing x and y values for as long as the animation is supposed to continue.


What we really want is something like g.fillOval(x,y,100,100); where each time paintComponent() is called, the oval gets painted at a 
different location.

But where do we get the new x and y values from? And who calls the repaint() method?
