#Creating two buttons 

We need four widgets now - a label, a label changing button, a circle and a button that changes the colour of the circle.

And we need to get two events. Two get multiple events, we use the concept of inner classes inside a class which can use the outer class's
variables and methods as if they were its own. We shall make two such classes for two action events. 

The main GUI class won't implement ActionListener interface now.
