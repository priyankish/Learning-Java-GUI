Things to remember:
1) Follow the order in which files have been given. 
2) Do not gloss over the text portions. They are important.
3) Extended descriptions for the code commits are very important too. The numbered comments in the code are related to these descriptions. If a file has been updated, go to history and look up the description of its first commit.
